# Load libraries so they are available
library("shiny")

# We'll begin by defining some of the UI elements as variables
# This helps keep the code organized and easier to debug

# Define a variable `intro_panel` for your first page. It should be a
# `tabPanel()` with a title "Introduction" to represent the first tab.
# This layout will contain the following elements:

intro_panel <- tabPanel("Introduction",
                        
  # A `titlePanel()` with the text "Income Inequality"
  titlePanel("Income Inequality"),

  # A paragraph `p()` describing with the text: "The below diagram was created
  # by the New York Times to illustrate the increasing level of inequality in
  # the US."
  
  p("The below diagram was created by the New York Times to illustrate the increasing level of inequality inthe US."),

  # An image `img()` to display. This content should have a `src` attribute of
  # "inequality.png" (which will refer to the file in the `www/` folder).
  
  img(src = "inequality.png", alt = "Example NYT Chart"),

  # A paragraph containing a hyperlink `a()` to the source of the article at
  # https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html

  p(a(href = "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html", "(source)")),
  
  # A paragraph containing a 1-2 sentence description of what the diagram
  # shows. Your paragraph should include both `strong()` and emphasized `em()`
  # text.
  
  p("The diagram shows how income percentile changed over time. Initally, strong(the non-upper class) saw the most growth, but then 
              gradually loss growth, while the upper class saw an em(exponential increase in growth)"),

# Next, we'll define a few UI elements to render in our second panel

# Define a variable `sidebar_content` as a `sidebarPanel()` UI element
# containing the following information:

  # A `sliderInput()` for the 'percentile' value, labeled "Income Percentile".
  # This slider should let the user pick a range between 0 and 100

  sidebar_content <- sidebarPanel(
    sliderInput(inputId = "percentile", label = "Income Percentile", min = 0, max = 100, value = c(0, 100))
  ),  

# Define a variable `main_content` as a `mainPanel()` UI element
# containing the following information:

  # A `plotOutput()` element showing the 'plot' output (defined in the server)


  # A paragraph with a hyperlink to the data source
  # http://gabriel-zucman.eu/usdina/

  main_content <- mainPanel(
    plotOutput("plot"),
    p("Source:" , a(href = "http://gabriel-zucman.eu/usdina/", "http://gabriel-zucman.eu/usdina/"))
  ),
    
    
# Define a variable `growth_panel` for your second page. It should be a
# `tabPanel()` with a title "Growth Chart" to represent the second tab.
# This layout will contain the following elements:

  # A `titlePanel()` with the text "Income growth 1980-2014"
  

  # A `sidebarLayout()` to create two columns.
  # The sidebar layout will contain elements:

    # Your `sidebar_content`

    # Your `main_content`
  
  growth_panel <- tabPanel("Growth Chart", titlePanel("Income growth 1980-2014"), sidebarLayout(sidebar_content,main_content))
)    

# Finally, define a `ui` variable, assigning it a `navbarPage()` layout.
# You will use `shinyUI()` to render this variable (in `app.R`)
# Give the layout a title of "Income Inequality".
# The layout should include the following elements:
# - Your `intro_panel`
# - Your `growth_panel`

ui <- navbarPage( "Income Inequality", intro_panel, growth_panel)
